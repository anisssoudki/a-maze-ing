Rails-js project

modules: player, maze, ball, goal 

maze module concers : 
1- how to generate the maze
2-how to draw on the screen
3-key mapping of ball or controlled object
4-detecting the collision between ball and goal
5- we need an algorithm to generate the maze 
6- idea of recursion comes into play 
7-i'm probably going to use matter.js (a library for js )
8- matter.js has the ability to map key presses to movements of shapes 
9- matter.js has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes
10- link for matter.js documentation https://brm.io/matter-js/
11- matter.js github https://github.com/liabru/matter-js#install we can use npm install or use a cdn to link this library
12- link for cdn https://www.cdnpkg.com/matter-js
script should have this in it inside of index.html

matter js terminology to be aware of: 

World => object that contains all of the different "objects" in the matter app 

engine => reads the current state of the world object, then calculate changes in positions of all the different shapes 

runner => gets the engine and world to work together, runs 60 frames per second (games usually run in an infinte loop think about this as an infinte loop using regular javascript)

render => does what it means it renders things on the screen 
body => A shape we are displaying can be a circle rect or whatever matter offers us 



this is one of the source codes of one of the example matter.js library gives us https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/blob/master/examples/mixed.js we are able to see how it works we use Matter.(keyword) where key word can be engine render runner ect... 
in our code we are going to use destructuring to make things simpler the code in the link is written with var a while back but we are gonna use const because its a better way of declaring variables

so far we have one shape on the screen if we look at the world variable in the console we can see a lot of properties that matter.js gives us stuff like position or speed

so far I have set up matter js and displayed a wall around the canvas now, im gonna start some of the backend functionality to see what data im going to utilize in the data base 
there is 2 ways i can do this 
the first one would be to have a player signup/login, pick a difficulty and the difficulty will be one of the params of the maze class than when the game finishes it will submit the score which is gonna be the difficulty level times a timer, so there is still a lot of work to do...  but the idea is having a player and a game 
game belongs to a player and a player can have many games those games will have attributes such as time or score and difficulty.
